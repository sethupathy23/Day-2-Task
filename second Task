Diffrence between Document and Window?

Document:-

1). Document represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.

2). we are using the document for accessing the DOM

3). It is loaded inside the window.

4). It is the object of window property.

5). All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.

6). The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)


syntax:

      document.propertyname;

HTML PAGE in my VScode:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is super cool ❤️</h1>
    <script src="first.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

JAVASCRIPT PAGE in my VScode:-


console.log(document.getElementsByTagName(`h1`)[0].textContent);

OUTPUT:-

This is super cool ❤️


Window:-


1). Window represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   

	
2). It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.


3). It is the object of the browser.


4). Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.


5). We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

The window is part of BOM, not DOM.


syntax:

window.propertyname;

Example 1:-

JAVASCRIPT PAGE in my VScode:-

console.log(window.alert("cool page"));

OUTPUT:-

pop up message will come and cool page and click OK button.


Example 2:-

JAVASCRIPT PAGE in my VScode:-

console.log(window.confirm("Are you sure you want to close?"));

OUTPUT:-
Pop up message will come. Are you sure you want to close? and click OK and CANCEL button.
